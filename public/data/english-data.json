      "paragraph": "I am passionate about programming and PC hardware maintenance. Curiosity and a strong desire to learn led me to explore the world of web development in 2022 when I started deepening my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS through online courses. This experience sparked a deep interest in web development, motivating me to pursue a full-stack developer course at TNV Academy in Cagliari in 2023. Lately, I have been primarily focusing on Angular, refining my skills in this framework to create modern and dynamic user interfaces. At the same time, I have developed a growing interest in technologies such as React, MongoDB, and Express. Additionally, I have proficiency in Java and Spring."
